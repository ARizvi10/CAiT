CAiT is my Cat AI Chatbot based off my own real life cat, Cleo. This script utilizes the DialoGPT Large model primed with a custom prompt to provide more meaningful responses. I used DialoGPT for it's support for Token-Level Conversation History.

Chatbot Overview

CAiT is more than just a chatbot — it’s my attempt to bring the sass, curiosity, and personality of Cleo to life through AI.
Built with DialoGPT-Large, A GPT model from HuggingFace.co, this chatbot is primed with a custom prompt written from my experience of living with my cat, simulating what I feel her responses
would be if she could speak human.

Why DialoGPT? I chose it for its Token-Level Conversation History, which helps maintain conversational context and allows for more coherent back-and-forth exchanges — just like chatting with a cheeky feline.
